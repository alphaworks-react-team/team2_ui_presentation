## General UI Principles

### 1. Place users in control of the interface: Keep users in control makes them comfortable and want to use your site.
* Make actions reversible
* Create an easy-to-navigate interface (Provide visual cues/Predictability)
* Provide informative feedback (Every action should have a clear reaction)
* Show the visibility of system status (Countdown timer)
### 2. Make it comfortable for a user to interact with a product
* Eliminate all elements that is irrelevant to your users experience
* Don’t ask users for data they’ve already entered
* Avoid jargon and system-oriented terminology (Use easy terms we all understand “buy” instead of “roost”)
* Design large targets for important functions
* Design accessible interfaces that try to accommodate for everyone
* Use real world metaphors (ex. A trash bin to signify “delete” or “trash”)
* Engineer for errors (Error messages to help guide user)
* Protect a user’s work (Users should not lose their work due to an error)
### 3. Reduce the amount of mental processing power required to use a product
* Chunking for sequences of international or actions (ex. Using indentations in phone numbers to help with a cluttered look. 5101234567 vs. (510)123-4567))
* Reduce the number of actions require to complete a task (“KISS” - T.S.)
* Recognition over recall (ex. Mail logo for e-mail instead of re-inventing the mail icon to be unique)
* Promote visual Clarity (Less clutter, more contrasting colors, organization [rule of 3rds!!!])
### 4. Make user interfaces consistent
* Visual consistency [style] (Same colors, fonts, and icons should be present throughout the product)
* Functional consistency [Behavior] Objects should work the same throughout the whole interface
* Consistent with user expectations (Follow platform conventions. Don’t reinvent patterns. Don’t try to reinvent terminology)

## The Gutenberg Diagram

![Gutenberg Diagram](http://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/writgutenberg-diagram.png)

"The Gutenberg diagram describes a general pattern the eyes move through when looking at evenly distributed, homogenous information..."

The pattern applies to text-heavy content (i.e. novels, newspaper)

Gutenberg diagram divides layout into 4 quadrants
- Primary optical area **TOP/LEFT**
- Strong fallow area **TOP/RIGHT**
- Weak fallow area **BOTTOM/LEFT**
- Terminal (Primary) area **BOTTOM/RIGHT**

"Reading gravity path" is a term to describe the natural movement of your eyes that sweep across and down the page in a series of horizontal movements called "axes of orientation".

Also suggested by the "Gutenberg diagram", the strong and weak fallow areas fall outside of this "reading gravity path" which then receive minimal attention unless emphasized visually.

Important elements should be placed along this reading gravity path (ex Logo in top/left ,image in center of page, call to action(button or eye catcher), contact info in bottom right).

"Naturally this is for left to right reading languages and would be reversed for right to left reading languages." This may be true however most of the research found below on this topic are done through the western lens.

## Z-Pattern Layout

![z-pattern](http://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/writz-pattern.png)

As the name describes you can assume the layout follows the shape of the letter Z. 

Readers will start at the **top left**, go to the **top right**, followed a diagonal move to the **bottom left** and then finish at the **bottom right**.

The main difference between Gutenberg diagram is that the **Z-pattern** suggests the viewers will pass through the fallow areas, while the Gutenberg diagram suggest viewers will usually skip the fallow areas all together.

"The **Z-pattern** is good for simple designs with a few key elements that need to be seen..."

### Zig-Zag Pattern ###

We can extend the **Z-pattern** by doing a series of z-movements instead of one big z-movement.

Naturally readers will continue to move to the right and then down back to the left and continue right repeating that over and over until we get to the bottom right or terminal area. This is refereed to a zig-zag pattern. This predictability allows designers to create layouts that allows for better readability and overall efficiency of use.


### Golden Triangle Pattern

![Golden Triangle](http://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/writgolden-triangle.png)

The **Z-pattern** also leads to what's called as the golden triangle pattern. If you go from **top/left** to **top/right** down to **bottom/left** that creates the **golden triangle**. This pattern suggest your most important information needs to be placed inside of the triangle.
